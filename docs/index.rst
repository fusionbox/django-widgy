django-widgy
============

django-widgy is a heterogeneous tree editor for Django that is
well-suited for use as a CMS. A heterogeneous tree is a tree where
each node can be a different type---just like HTML. Widgy provides
the representation for heterogeneous trees as well as an interactive
JavaScript editor for them. Widgy supports Django 1.4+.

Widgy was originally created for powerful content management, but it can
have many different uses.
