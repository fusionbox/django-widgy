   :alt: Build Status

Widgy is a content editor somewhat in the line of CKEditor. It is not a
WYSIWYG editor though. Widgy is more suited than CKEditor for editing
pages, as in a CMS because it allows you to edit specific parts of the
page and those parts know how to render themselves. Whereas a WYSIWYG
stores its data in HTML, Widgy stores it in a Tree where each node can
render itself.

Widgy is available under the Apache Version 2.0 license. Contribute on github.
