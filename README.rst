   :alt: Build Status

Widgy is a content editor somewhat in the line of CKEditor. It is not a
WYSIWYG editor though. Widgy is more suited than CKEditor for editing
pages, as in a CMS because it allows you to edit specific parts of the
page and those parts know how to render themselves. Whereas a WYSIWYG
stores its data in HTML, Widgy stores it in a Tree where each node can
render itself.

Widgy is available under the 2-clause BSD license. Contribute on github.

Installation
------------

Widgy does not yet have a stable release, so it should be installed from
source. ::

When developing Widgy, it might be handy to clone the repository then install
it. ::

Running the Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    make test

``make test`` will run both the JavaScript and Python tests. To test one
or the other, use ``make test-js`` or ``make test-py``.

Coverage
********
Once coverage_ is installed (``pip install coverage``), the Makefile
has two commands to help report on code coverage. ::

    make coverage

will run the tests with coverage enabled and generate HTML coverage
files. ::

    make browser

will run the tests and open the coverage report in your web browser.
